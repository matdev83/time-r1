## üõ†Ô∏è Coding Standards & Best Practices

Adherence to high-quality coding standards and software engineering principles is paramount for this project. You are expected to follow:

* **PEP 8**: Python Enhancement Proposal 8 for code style.
* **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before writing the code they are meant to test. Ensure high test coverage.
* **SOLID Principles**:
  * **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
  * **O**pen/Closed Principle
  * **L**iskov Substitution Principle
  * **I**nterface Segregation Principle
  * **D**ependency Inversion Principle
* **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid duplication of code and logic.
* **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Favor simplicity and clarity in your designs and implementations.

**Tooling for Code Quality**: The project utilizes automated tools to enforce these standards:

* `black` (code formatter)
* `isort` (import sorter)
* `ruff` (fast Python linter)
* `mypy` (static type checker)

Your contributions will be evaluated against these standards and the acceptance criteria defined in `dev/PLAN.md`.
